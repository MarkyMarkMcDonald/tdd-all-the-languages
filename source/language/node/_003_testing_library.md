Now let's install the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework:

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev jasmine
$ npm install --global jasmine
```

Jasmine will then be added to both your project's `package.json` (`--save-dev`) as well as globally (`--global`) so you can easilly use it from the command-line.

Now we'll initialize our project to use Jasmine:

```sh
$ jasmine --init
```

Then run `jasmine` to ensure everything is set up correctly
