Let's make a directory for our project. This is where we'll be putting all our code.

```sh
$ mkdir piglatin-ruby
$ cd piglatin-ruby
```

Then we can use rbenv to specify the version of Ruby we want to use for this project:

```sh
$ rbenv local 2.2.3
```

This will create a file named `.ruby-version` that contains the string `2.2.3`. This lets rbenv know what version of Ruby to use the next time you change into this directory to work on this project.
