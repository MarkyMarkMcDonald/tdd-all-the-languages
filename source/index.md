# TDD All the Languages!

When I want to play around with a new language I start by trying to make a Piglatin translator and I try to build it using Test Driven Development.

Regardless of the language, the journey is pretty much the same - I need to know:

- how to install the language
- what the project structure should be
- what build tool to use
- how to automatically manage dependencies
- what testing framework to use
- what to put it `.gitignore`
- how to get it working in a Continuous Integration server
- how to deploy my library so others can use it
- etc.

This project is an attempt to document that process for as many languages as possible.

It assumes you are on a Mac and using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
